          I am a passionate and dedicated Full Stack Developer with a focus on

          (BCA, 2019-2022) and a Master’s degree in Computer Applications (MCA,
          2022-2024) from GGSIPU University, I am always eager to apply and
          expand my technical knowledge. Currently, I am freelancing as a Full
          Stack Developer, delivering high-quality projects that meet my
          clients' expectations. My goal is to thrive in an environment that
          fosters growth and excellence, where I can contribute to achieving
          both personal and organizational goals. I am always open to
